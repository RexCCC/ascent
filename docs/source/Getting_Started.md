# Getting Started
## Installation
### Installing commercial software

It is *highly* recommended that you use a distribution of Anaconda/Miniconda with ASCENT. However, advanced users who wish to use another Python distribution may.

First, these software packages must be manually installed:
* [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)/[Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) We recommend that you install Miniconda (Miniconda is a stripped down version of Anaconda; Anaconda is optional for intermediate users). If you alread have an existing installation, there is no need to reinstall.
    - Recommended: Select add to path
    - Recommended: Select "Install for individual user"
    - https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html
    - https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual
* [Java SE Development Kit 8 (1.8)](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/javase-jdk8-downloads.html) (need to register for a free account)
    - [https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/javase-jdk8-downloads.html](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/javase-jdk8-downloads.html)
* [Homebrew](https://docs.brew.sh/Installation) (Mac and Linux only)
  - ```/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"```
  - ```brew install wget```
* [COMSOL 5.4 or newer](https://www.comsol.com/product-download) (requires purchase of license; only based package needed, which includes the COMSOL Java API)
  - Once COMSOL is installed, alter 'File System Access' permissions via  File → Preferences → Security → Methods and Java Libraries → File System Access → All Files.
  - Open the COMSOL Server and log in with a username and password of your choosing (arbitrary and not needed thereafter). This can be done by navigating to the bin/ directory in the COMSOL installation and running ```comsolmphserver``` (Windows) or ```./comsol server``` (MacOS/Linux).
  - [https://www.comsol.com/product-download](https://www.comsol.com/product-download)
* [NEURON 7.6](https://neuron.yale.edu/ftp/neuron/versions/v7.6/) (newer versions have been released, but compatibility has yet to be confirmed; choose appropriate installer depending on operating system; install auxiliary software as prompted by NEURON installer)
    - [https://neuron.yale.edu/ftp/neuron/versions/v7.6/](https://neuron.yale.edu/ftp/neuron/versions/v7.6/)
    - If having issues with the NEURON installation, try running the compatibility troubleshooter.

In this stage of development, all programs/commands are run from a command line environment on both MacOS/Linux and Windows operating systems (Bash terminal for MacOS/Linux, Powershell for Windows). For users less familiar with this environment and for the quickest setup, it is suggested that the user install the package management system [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) or [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) (if using MacOS, choose .pkg for ease of use).

Note that compiling NEURON files (when submitting sims) requires that the following packages be installed and on your path (Mac and Linux ONLY):
  - openmpi-2.0.0
  - libreadlines.so.6

If using MacOS to run local NEURON simulations, it may be necessary to install the Xcode Command Line Tools via ```xcode-select --install```, as well as [Xquartz](https://www.xquartz.org/releases/XQuartz-2.7.11.html).

Users may also download a text editor or integrated development environment (IDE) of their choosing to view/edit code (e.g., [Atom](https://atom.io/), [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/)). For Java code, full autocomplete functionality requires adding both the path to the COMSOL installation ending in `plugins` as well as the path ```<ASCENT_PATH>/bin/json-20190722.jar``` to the list of available libraries (usually from within the IDE’s project settings).

### Installing ASCENT

1. First, download or clone the SPARC ASCENT pipeline from [GitHub](https://github.com/wmglab-duke/ascent) to a desired location that will be referenced in step 3. Downloading is a much simpler process than cloning via Git, but does not easily allow for you to get the most recent updates/bug fixes, nor does it allow you to suggest new features/changes. If you are interested in either of these features, you should clone via Git rather than downloading.
    * Downloading: Click the [download](https://github.com/wmglab-duke/ascent/archive/refs/heads/master.zip) button on GitHub and choose the location to which you would like to save. Note that you will need to extract the files, as they will be downloaded in a compressed format. When presented with a choice of compression format, ".zip" is a safe choice that most computers will be able to extract.
    * Cloning via Git:
        1. You must first have an account with GitHub, and if you have been granted special permissions to the code repository, you must use the email address to which those permissions were granted.
        2. If you have not already done so, add an SSH key to your account (see instructions for [GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/connecting-to-github-with-ssh)). This is a required standard authentication method.
        3. In a Miniconda (or Git, for advanced users) command line environment, navigate to the location to where you would like to clone the code repository (see instructions for navigating the file system from the command line for [Mac or Linux](https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/navigating-linux-filesystem) and [Windows](https://blogs.umass.edu/Techbytes/2014/11/14/file-navigation-with-windows-command-prompt/)).
        4. Clone the repository (see instructions for [GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository)).
        5. For more information on using Git, check out the [official documentation](https://git-scm.com/doc).

2. Next, install ASCENT dependencies:
    * Windows: Open the Anaconda Powershell Prompt from the Windows Start Menu as Administrator, and use cd to navigate to the root directory of the pipeline. Then, run ```python run install```. Note: If reinstalling ASCENT after having changed your Anaconda/Miniconda installation, it may be necessary to delete the `#region conda initialize` block from `C:\Users\<username>\Documents\WindowsPowerShell\profile.ps1` in order to use Anaconda Powershell Prompt.
    * MacOS/Linux: Open Anaconda Prompt and use cd to navigate to the root directory of the pipeline. Then, run ```python run install```.
    * For advanced users using their own (non-conda) Python distribution:
      - From the ascent root directory execute ```python run install --no-conda```
      - From the ascent root directory execute ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
      - This method is highly discouraged as newer versions of packages/Python could potentially break ASCENT or introduce unexpected bugs

After confirming that you are in the correct directory, the script will install the required Python packages: Pillow {cite:p}`clark2015pillow`, NumPy {cite:p}`harris2020array`, Shapely {cite:p}`shapely2007`, Matplotlib {cite:p}`Hunter:2007`, PyClipper {cite:p}`pyclipper2015`, pygame {cite:p}`pygame2011`, QuantiPhy {cite:p}`quantiphy2016`, OpenCV {cite:p}`opencv_library`, PyMunk {cite:p}`pymunk`, and SciPy {cite:p}`Virtanen2020`, pandas {cite:p}`reback2020pandas,mckinney-proc-scipy-2010`, OpenPyXL {cite:p}`OpenpyXL2020`, scikit-image {cite:p}`van2014scikit`,
ffmpeg {cite:p}`tomar2006converting`, xlsxwriter {cite:p}`xlsxwriter2017`, seaborn {cite:p}`Waskom2021`. It is crucial that all of the packages are installed successfully (check for "successfully installed" for each package). The installation script will also create a shortcut to the newly configured ASCENT Conda "environment" on your project path, which can be used for running the pipeline.

3. Then, configure the environment variables. This step may be completed several ways, described below.
    * Recommended Setup: Open Anaconda prompt, navigate to the ASCENT root directory, and  execute ```python run env_setup```. You will be prompted for the following paths:
      - ASCENT_COMSOL_PATH: Path to the COMSOL installation, ending in the directory name "Multiphysics", as seen in the template and [JSON Overview](JSON/JSON_overview).
      - ASCENT_JDK_PATH: Path to the JDK 1.8 installation, ending in ```bin```, as seen in the template and [JSON Overview](JSON/JSON_overview). Hint: This is the correct path if the directory contains many executables (for Windows: java.exe, etc.; MacOS/Linux: java, etc.).
      - ASCENT_PROJECT_PATH: Path to the root directory of the pipeline, as chosen for step 1.
      - ASCENT_NSIM_EXPORT_PATH: Path to the export location for NEURON "simulation" directories. This path only depends on on the user's desired file system organization.
    * Manual Setup: Copy the file ```config/templates/env.json``` into ```config/system/env.json``` (new file). This file holds important paths for software used by the pipeline (see env.json in [Enums](Code_Hierarchy/Python.md#enums) and [JSON Overview](JSON/JSON_overview)). Then, edit each of the four values as specified below. Use ```\\``` in Windows and ```/``` in MacOS/Linux operating systems. Note that the file separators are operating system dependent, so even if you installed in step 2 with Unix-like command environment on a Windows machine (e.g., using [Git Bash](https://gitforwindows.org/), [Cygwin](https://www.cygwin.com/), or a VM with [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/)), you will still need to choose the proper file separator for Windows, i.e., ```\\```). See example env.json files for both MacOS and Windows ([Environment Parameters](JSON/JSON_parameters/env)).
    * Automatic setup: Upon the initiation of your first run, you will be prompted to enter the above four paths if you did not choose to complete the manual setup. Enter them as prompted, following the guidelines detailed above and exemplified in [JSON Overview](JSON/JSON_overview). Note that you may at any time update paths with ```python run env_setup``` to rewrite this file if the information should change.

## Metadata required to model an in vivo experiment using the ASCENT pipeline
Note: All metadata required for the [tutorial run](#tutorial-run) are provided with ASCENT.

1.  Detailed specifications / dimensions of the stimulating cuff
    electrode.

2.  Transverse cross section of the nerve where the cuff is placed,
    stained to visualize the different tissue types (e.g., using
    Masson’s trichrome), with a scale bar ([Fig 2](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1009285.g002) and Running_ASCENT/Info.md#morphology-Input-Files)) or known scale (micrometers/pixel). Different possible sources
    for defining the nerve sample morphology include:

    a.  For best specificity, the nerve would be sampled from the
        specific animal used in the experiment being modeled. In this
        case, two colors of tissue dye may be used on the ventral and
        medial aspects of the nerve to maintain orientation information.

    b.  Otherwise, a sample from another animal of the same species
        could be used at the correct nerve level.

    c.  If multiple samples from other animals are available, they could
        be used to generate a representative nerve model, knowing the
        range of morphological metrics across individuals using the
        `scripts/mock_morphology_generator.py` script ([Mock Morphology](MockSample)).

    d.  Lastly, published data could be used.

3.  Orientation and rotation of the cuff on the nerve (e.g., cuff
    closure on the ventral side of the nerve).

4.  Fiber diameters

    a.  Distributions of fiber diameters may be obtained from
        literature; otherwise, detailed electromicroscopic studies are
        required.

    b.  The fiber diameters found in the target nerve that will be
        simulated in NEURON. All diameters or a subset of diameters may
        be of interest.

    c.  Each fiber diameter of interest can be simulated for each fiber
        location of interest, or specific fiber diameters can be
        simulated in specific locations.

5.  Approximate tissue or fluids surrounding the nerve and cuff (e.g.,
    muscle, fat, or saline).

6.  Stimulation waveforms, pulse widths, and other parameters of the
    electrical signal.

7.  If comparing to neural recordings: distance between the stimulation
    and recording cuffs.

8.  If comparing to functional recordings (e.g., EMG): distance from the
    stimulation cuff to the location where the nerve inserts into the
    muscle.

## Tutorial Run

We sent the pipeline code, manuscript, and the following task to beta
testers (both within our lab at Duke and externally). Following this
task and verifying the threshold value is a suitable way to familiarize
yourself with the ASCENT code and documentation.

We provide segmented histology of a rat cervical vagus nerve
(`examples/beta_task/`). Use the provided histology and configurations files to simulate activation thresholds in
response to a charge balanced, biphasic pulse (PW1 = 100 μs, interphase
gap of 100 μs, PW2 = 400 μs) using Purdue’s bipolar cuff design.

  - MRG 8.7 μm diameter fibers

  - Fibers placed in nerve cross section using a 6 spoke wheel with 2
    fibers per spoke

  - Custom material for surrounding medium with isotropic conductivity
    1/20 \[S/m\]

After your thresholds have been computed, build a heatmap for the
threshold at each fiber location using the example script:
`examples/analysis/heatmap.py`.

Through this exercise, you will:

  - Place and name binary masks of the nerve morphology in the proper
    directories

      - Binary masks provided

  - Define and assign a custom material

  - Build and solve a finite element model

  - Define placement of fibers in the nerve cross section

  - Parameterize your custom stimulation waveform

  - Simulate activation thresholds for a specific fiber model by
    submitting NEURON simulations locally or to a computer cluster

  - Generate a heatmap of fiber activation thresholds

Check: Threshold for inner0\_fiber0 (`thresh_inner0_fiber0.dat`) should
be -0.027402 mA

We provided ***Sample***, ***Model***, and ***Sim*** JSON files for the
solution in `examples/beta_task/`. Use the steps below in order to set up this tutorial run.

## Setting up a run of ASCENT

*How to run the ASCENT pipeline, after completing the initial setup.*

To set up a run of the pipeline, you must provides binary mask inputs for the nerve and save ***Sample***
(i.e., `sample.json`), ***Model(s)*** (i.e., `model.json`), and ***Sim(s)***
(i.e., `sim.json`) JSON configurations in directories, relative to the
project path defined in `config/system/env.json`. The directory names must
use indices that are consistent with the indices of ***Sample***,
***Model(s)***, and ***Sim(s)*** defined in ***Run***.

1.  ***Masks:*** Populate `input/<NAME>/` (e.g., "Rat1-1", which
    must match "sample" parameter in ***Sample***) with binary masks of
    neural tissue boundaries using either:

    a.  Segmented histology (Running_ASCENT/Info.md#morphology-Input-Files) and [Fig 2](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1009285.g002)), or

    b.  The `mock_morphology_generator.py` script ([Mock Morphology](MockSample)).

       1.  Copy `mock_sample.json` from `config/templates/` to
            `config/user/mock_samples/` as `<mock_sample_index>.json`
            and update file contents, including the "NAME" parameter
            used to construct the destination path for the output binary
            masks, which serve as inputs to the pipeline.

       1.  Call `"python run mock_morphology_generator
            <mock_sample_index>"`.

       11.  The program saves a copy of your `mock_sample.json` and
            binary masks in `input/<NAME>/`.

2.  ***For one Sample:*** Copy `sample.json` from `config/templates/`
    to `samples/<sample_index>/` as `sample.json` and edit its contents
    to define the processing of binary masks to generate the
    two-dimensional cross section geometry of the nerve in the FEM. In
    particular, change "sample" to match `<NAME>`, the
    `"scale_bar_length"` parameter for `s.tif` (i.e., length in microns
    of your scale bar, which is oriented horizontally), and
    `"mask_input"` in ***Sample*** accordingly ([Sample Parameters](JSON/JSON_parameters/sample)). You have now created
    the directory for your first sample: `sample #<sample_index>`. Note: in lieu of a scale bar image, the user may optionally specify the microns/pixel ratio for the sample mask(s).


3.  ***For each Model:*** Copy `model.json` from `config/templates/`
    to `samples/<sample_index>/models/<model_index>/` as `model.json`
    and edits its contents to define the three dimensional FEM.

    a. Assign the cuff geometry to be used by placing a file name from `config/system/cuffs` in `"cuff":"preset"`.

    b. Optionally, define a new cuff geometry specific to your needs:
      1.  ***Preset:*** User defines a new "preset" cuff JSON file, which
          contains instructions for creating their cuff electrode, and
          saves it as `config/system/cuffs/<preset_str>.json`.

      1.  The `<preset_str>.json` file name must be assigned to the
          "preset" parameter in ***Model*** ([Model Parameters](JSON/JSON_parameters/model)).

4.  ***For each Sim:*** Copy `sim.json` from `config/templates/` to
    `config/user/sims/` as `<sim_index>.json` and edit its contents to
    inform the NEURON simulations ([Sim Parameters](JSON/JSON_parameters/sim)).

5.  ***Run:*** Copy `run.json` from `config/templates/` to
    `config/user/runs/` as `<run_index>.json` and edit the indices for
    the created ***Sample***, ***Model(s)***, and ***Sim(s)***
    configurations ([Run Parameters](JSON/JSON_parameters/run)).

6.  The pipeline is run from the project path (i.e., the path to the
    root of the ASCENT pipeline, which is defined in
    `config/system/env.json`) with the command `"python run pipeline <run
    indices>"`, where `<run indices>` is a list of space-separated
    ***Run*** indices (if multiple ***Sample*** indices, one ***Run***
    for each). The pipeline outputs ready-to-submit NEURON simulations
    and associated ***Run file(s)*** to the `"ASCENT_NSIM_EXPORT_PATH"`
    directory as defined in `config/system/env.json` ([Environment Parameters](JSON/JSON_parameters/env)). NEURON simulations
    are run locally or submitted to a computer cluster with the command
    `"python submit.py <run indices>"` from the export directory.
