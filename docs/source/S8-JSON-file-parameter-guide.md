# JSON file parameter guide

Notes:

See [S7 Text](S7-JSON-configuration-files) for a general overview of the contents and usage of each of the following JSON files used in ASCENT.

`“//"` is not valid JSON syntax; comments are not possible in JSON.
However, we sparingly used this notation in the JSON examples below to
provide context or more information about the associated line. Each
value following a key in the syntax denotes the *type* of the value, not
its literal value: “\[\<Type X\>, …\]” syntax indicates that the type is
an array of Type X. Occasionally, a single value may be substituted for
the list if only a single value is desired, but this functionality
differs between keys, so be sure to read the documentation before
attempting for any given key-value pair. If a parameter is optional, the
entire key-value can be omitted from the JSON file and the default value
will be used.

For calculated values, the user can either keep the key with a dummy
value or remove the key entirely when setting up JSON files for a
pipeline run.

JSON Object names, keys, and values (e.g., filename strings) are
case-sensitive.

The order of key-value pairs within a JSON Object does not matter.
Saving/loading the file to/from memory is likely to reorder the contents
of the file.

## run.json

1.  Named file: `config/user/runs/<run_index>.json`

1.  Purpose: Instructs the pipeline on which input data and user-defined
    parameters to use in a single program “run”, where one “run”
    configuration serves a single ***Sample*** and a list of
    ***Model(s)*** and ***Sims(s)***. Enables operational control
    (breakpoints, which FEM files to save/discard). Keeps track of
    successful/failed FEMs in Java.

1.  Syntax: To declare this entity in `config/user/runs/`, use the
    following syntax:
    ```
    {
      "pseudonym": String,
      "submission_context": String,
      "sample": Integer, // note, only one value here!
      "models": [Integer, ...], // pipeline will create all pairwise combos of …
      "sims": [Integer, ...], // … models and sims
      "recycle_meshes": Boolean,
      "break_points": {
        "pre_java": Boolean, // before Runner’s handoff() method to Java/COMSOL
        "pre_geom_run": Boolean, // immediately before geometry operations
        "post_geom_run": Boolean, // immediately after geometry operations
        "pre_mesh_proximal": Boolean, // immediately before mesh prox operations
        "post_mesh_proximal": Boolean, // immediately post mesh prox operations
        "pre_mesh_distal": Boolean, // immediately before mesh dist operations
        "post_mesh_distal": Boolean, // immediately post mesh dist operations
        "post_material_assign": Boolean, // immediately post assigning materials
        "pre_loop_currents": Boolean // immediately before solving for bases
      },
      "models_exit_status": [Boolean, ...], // one entry for each Model
      "endo_only_solution": Boolean,
      "keep": {
        "debug_geom": Boolean,
        "mesh": Boolean,
        "bases": Boolean
      },
      "export_behavior": String,
      "partial_fem": {
        "cuff_only": Boolean,
        "nerve_only": Boolean
      },
      "local_avail_cpus": Integer,
      "popup_plots": Boolean,
      "auto_submit_fibers": true
    }
    ```
1.  Properties:

    `"pseudonym"`: This value (String) informs pipeline print statements, allowing
    users to better keep track of the purpose of each configuration file. Optional.

    `“submission_context”`: The value (String) of this property tells the
    system how to submit the n\_sim NEURON jobs based on the computational
    resources available. Value can be “cluster”, “local”, or "auto" (if "auto", "hostname_prefix" is required). Required.

    `"hostname_prefix"`: This value (String) tells the program what prefix to look out for in the "HOSTNAME" environment variable. If the "HOSTNAME" begins with the "hostname prefix", submission context is set to cluster, otherwise it is set to local (does not change the value in the configuration file). Example: if your high performance computing cluster hostname always begins with ourclust, e.g. ourclust-node-15, ourclust-login-20, etc., you would set the value of this variable to "ourclust." If the "HOSTNAME" environment variable is not present, the program defaults to "local." Required if "submission_context" is "auto", otherwise Optional.

    `“sample”`: The value (Integer) of this property sets the sample
    configuration index (“***Sample***”). Note that this is only ever one
    value. To loop ***Samples***, create a ***Run*** for each. Required.

    `“models”`: The value (\[Integer, ...\]) of this property sets the model
    configuration indices (“***Model***”). Required.

    `“sims”`:  The value (\[Integer, ...\]) of this property sets the
    simulation configuration indices (“***Sim***”). Required.

    `“recycle_meshes”`: The value (Boolean) of this property instructs the
    pipeline to search for mesh matches for recycling a previously generated
    FEM mesh if set to true. If this property is not specified, the default
    behavior of the pipeline is false, meaning that it will not search for
    and recycle a mesh match (see `ModelSearcher` ([S26 Text](S26-Java-utility-classes)) and
    `mesh_dependent_model.json` ([S7 Text](S7-JSON-configuration-files))). Optional.

    `“break_points”`: The value (Boolean) of each breakpoint results in the
    program terminating or continuing with the next ***Model*** index. In
    Runner, the program checks that at most one breakpoint is true and
    throws an exception otherwise. The breakpoint locations enable the user
    to run only up to certain steps of the pipeline, which can be
    particularly useful for debugging. If a breakpoint is not defined, the
    default behavior is false (i.e., the pipeline continues beyond the
    breakpoint). Note: specifying a break point via command line arguments
    will override any break points set in your run config. Optional.

    `"endo_only_solution"`: The value (Boolean) determines what data the electric currents
    solution will save. Since fibers are sampled from the endoneurium, after the
    solution is completed, only the endoneurial Ve data is necessary to run fiber
    simulations. If `"endo_only_solution"` is `true`, then COMSOL will save ONLY
    the Ve data for the endoneurium. If `false`, COMSOL will save Ve data for the entire model.
    Recommended value is `true` unless you intend to generate plots or other analyses
    which require Ve data for geometry other than the endoneurium. If this key-value pair
    is not present, defaults to `false`. Note: this parameter only affects storage
    space after the solution has completed, and will not have any affect on memory
    usage or solution time.

    `“models_exit_status”`: The value (\[Boolean, ...\]) of this property
    indicates if Java successfully made the FEMs for the corresponding model
    indices (“models” property). The user does not need to include this
    property before performing a run of the pipeline, as it is automatically
    added in Java (COMSOL FEM processes) and is then used to inform Python
    operations for making NEURON simulations. The value will contain one
    value for each ***Model*** listed in “models”. If a ***Model*** fails,
    the pipeline will skip it and proceed to the next one. Automatically
    added.

    `“keep”`: The value (Boolean) of each property results in the program
    keeping or deleting large COMSOL `*.mph` files for the `“debug_geom.mph”`,
    `“mesh.mph”` and bases/ for a given ***Model***. If a keep property is not
    defined, the default behavior is true and the associated `*.mph` file is
    saved. If `“mesh.mph”` is saved, the file can later be used if another
    ***Model*** is a suitable “mesh match” and `“recycle_meshes”` is true
    (see `ModelSearcher` ([S26 Text](S26-Java-utility-classes)) and `mesh_dependent_model.json` ([S7 Text](S7-JSON-configuration-files))). If bases/ are saved, a
    new ***Sim*** for a previously computed ***Sample*** and ***Model*** can
    be probed along new fibersets/ to create potentials/*.* Optional.

    `"export_behavior"`: The value (String) instructs the pipeline how to behave if
    an export n_sim directory (i.e., ASCENT_NSIM_EXPORT_PATH/n_sims/<directory>)
    already exists. There are three options: `"selective"` is the default behavior,
    output directories which already exist will be skipped, but any which do not exist
    will be generated, `"overwrite"` will remove the extant directory,
    and generate a new clean output directory in its place, `"error"` instructs the
    pipeline to exit if any export n_sim directory is found to already exist.

    `“partial_fem”`: The value (Boolean) of each property results in the
    program terminating after building the COMSOL FEM geometry for only the
    cuff (`“cuff_only”`) or only the nerve (`“nerve_only”`). The program
    terminates after the `“debug_geom.mph”` file is created. If the
    `“partial_fem”` JSON Object is not included, the value of each Boolean
    is treated as false, meaning that the `“debug_geom.mph”` file will
    contain the nerve and cuff electrode. An error is thrown if the user may
    set both values for `“cuff_only”` and `“nerve_only”` to true. To build the
    geometry of both the cuff and the nerve, but not proceed with meshing or
    solving the FEM, the user should set the value for `“post_geom_run”`
    under `“break_points”` to true. Overriden
    if the `"partial_fem"` command line argument is used. Optional.

    `“local_avail_cpus”`: The value (Integer) sets the number of CPUs that
    the program will take if the `“submission_context”` is “local”. We check
    that the user is not asking for more than one less that the number of
    CPUs of their machine, such that at least one CPU is left for the
    machine to perform other processes. Optional, but if using submitting
    locally, the program will take all CPUs except 1 if this value is not
    defined.

    `“popup_plots”`: The value (Boolean) will instruct the pipeline to display plots
    (e.g. sample plot, fiberset plot, waveform plot) in a popup window. This is in addition
    to saving the plots in the relevant folders (i.e., the sample and sim folders).

    `"auto_submit_fibers"`: The value (Boolean), if true, will cause the program to automatically start fiber simulations after each run is completed.
    If submitting locally, the program will not continue to the next run until all fiber simulations are complete. If submitting via a computer cluster,
    the next run will start after all batch NEURON jobs are submitted.

1.  Example:
    ```
    {
      "pseudonym": "My example run",
      "submission_context": “cluster”,
      "sample": 62,
      "models": [0],

        "pre_mesh_proximal": false,
        "post_mesh_proximal": false,
        "pre_mesh_distal": false,
        "post_mesh_distal": false,
        "post_material_assign": false,  
        "pre_loop_currents": false
      },

        "debug_geom": true,
        "mesh": true,
        "bases": true
      },
      "partial_fem": {
        "cuff_only": false,
        "nerve_only": false
      },
      "export_behavior": "selective",
      "local_avail_cpus": 3,
      “popup_plots”: true,
      "auto_submit_fibers": false
    }
    ```
## sample.json

1.  Named file: `samples/<sample_index>/sample.json`

1.  Purpose: Instructs the pipeline on which sample-specific input data
    and user-defined parameters to use for processing nerve sample
    morphology inputs in preparation for 3D representation of the sample
    in the FEM (***Sample***) ([S7](S7-JSON-configuration-files) and [S14](S14-Creating-sample-specific-nerve-morphologies-in-COMSOL) Text).

            ]
          },
          ...
        ]
      }
    }
    ```
1.  Properties:

    `“sample”`: The value (String) of this property sets the sample
    name/identifier (e.g., “Rat1-1”) to relate to bookkeeping for input
    morphology files ([S3 Text Figure A](S3-ASCENT-data-hierarchy)). The value must match the directory name in
    `input/<NAME>/` that contains the input morphology files. Required.

    `"pseudonym"`: This value (String) informs pipeline print statements, allowing
    users to better keep track of the purpose of each configuration file. Optional.

    `“sex”`: The value (String) of this property assigns the sex of the
    sample. Optional, for user records only.

    `“level”`: The value (String) of this property assigns the location of the
    nerve sample (e.g., cervical, abdominal, pudendal). Optional, for user
    records only.

    `“samples_path”`: The value (\[String, ...\]) is the path to the
    directory containing input morphology files for all samples for a given
    project. Required.

    `“scale”`

      - `“scale_bar_length”`: The value (Double, units: micrometer) is the
        length of the scale bar in the binary image of the scale bar
        provided (`s.tif`, note that the scale bar must be oriented
        horizontally). Required if scale_input = "MASK".

      - `“scale_ratio”`: The value (Double, units: micrometers/pixel) is
        the ratio of micrometers per pixel for the input mask(s).
        Required if scale_input = "RATIO".

      - `“shrinkage”`: The value (Double) is the shrinkage correction for the
        nerve morphology binary images provided as a decimal (e.g., 0.20
        results in a 20% expansion of the nerve, and 0 results in no
        shrinkage correction of the nerve). Required, must be greater than
        0. Note: Shrinkage correction scaling is linear (i.e. a nerve with diameter d and area a scaled by scaling factor s will have a final diameter of d_final=d\*(1+s) and a final area a_final = a\*(1+s)<sup>2</sup>)

        <!-- end list -->

    `“boundary_separation”`

      - `“fascicles”`: The value (Double, units: micrometer) is the minimum
        distance required between boundaries of adjacent fascicles
        (post-deformation, see Deformable in [S13 Text](S13-Python-classes-for-representing-nerve-morphology-(Sample))). Required for samples with
        multiple fascicles.

          - Note that this is a distinct parameter from
            `“min_fascicle_separation”` in `mock_sample.json`, which
            controls the minimum distance between fascicles in the binary
            image mask inputs to the pipeline, which is later deformed to
            fit in the cuff electrode using Deformable ([S13 Text](S13-Python-classes-for-representing-nerve-morphology-(Sample))).

      - `“nerve”`: The value (Double, units: micrometer) is the minimum
        distance required between the boundaries of a fascicle and the nerve
        (post-deformation, see Deformable in [S13 Text](S13-Python-classes-for-representing-nerve-morphology-(Sample))). Required if “nerve” in
        ***Sample*** is “PRESENT”.

    `“modes”`: 

      - `“mask_input”`:  The value (String) is the `“MaskInputMode”` that tells
        the program which segmented histology images to expect as inputs for
        fascicles. Required.

          - As listed in Enums ([S6 Text](S6-Enums)), modes include 

            1.  `“INNERS”`: Program expects segmented images of only inner
                fascicle boundaries.

            2.  `“INNER_AND_OUTER_SEPARATE”`: Program expects segmented
                image of inners in one file and segmented image of outers in
                another file.

            3.  `“INNER_AND_OUTER_COMPILED”`: Program expects a single
                segmented image containing boundaries of both inners and
                outers.

      - `“scale_input”`: The value (String) is the `“ScaleInputMode”`
        that tells the program which type of scale input to look for.

          - As listed in Enums ([S6 Text](S6-Enums)), known `“ScaleInputModes”` include

            1.  `“MASK”`: The program will determine image scale from the user's scale bar mask image and the `scale_bar_length` parameter.
            2.  `“RATIO”`: The program will use the scale directly specified in `scale_ratio`. If using this option, a scale bar image need not be
                provided.

      - `“nerve”`: The value (String) is the `“NerveMode”` that tells the
        program if there is an outer nerve boundary (epineurium) segmented
        image to incorporate into the model. Required.

          - As listed in Enums ([S6 Text](S6-Enums)), known modes include

            1.  `“PRESENT”`: Program expects a segmented image for a nerve
                (`n.tif`) to incorporate into the model. The value must be
                PRESENT if multifascicular nerve, but can also be PRESENT
                if monofascicular.

            2.  `“NOT_PRESENT”`: Program does not try to incorporate a
                nerve boundary into the model. The value cannot be
                `NOT_PRESENT` if multifascicular nerve, but can be
                `NOT_PRESENT` if monofascicular.

      - `“deform”`: The value (String) is the `“DeformationMode”` that tells the
        program which method to use to deform the nerve within the cuff. If
        the `“NerveMode”` (i.e., “nerve” parameter) is defined as
        `“NOT_PRESENT”` then the `“DeformationMode”` (i.e., “deform”
        parameter) must be `“NONE”`. Required.

          - As listed in Enums ([S6 Text](S6-Enums)), known modes include

            1.  `“NONE”`: The program does not deform the nerve when it is
                placed in the cuff electrode. In the pipeline’s current
                implementation, this should be the value for all nerve
                samples without epineurium (i.e., `“NOT_PRESENT”` for
                “nerve”).

            2.  `“PHYSICS”`: The program uses a physics-based deformation of
                the nerve to the final inner profile of the nerve cuff,
                morphing from the original trace towards a circular trace.
                In the pipeline’s current implementation, this is the
                only `“DeformationMode”` for deforming compound nerve
                samples. See `“deform_ratio”` below; if `deform_ratio = 0`,
                then the original nerve trace is used and if `deform_ratio
                = 1`, then the nerve trace will be made circular.

      - `“ci_perineurium_thickness”`: The value (String) is the
        `“PerineuriumThicknessMode”` that tells the program which method to
        use to define perineurium thickness. Required.

          - As listed in Enums ([S6 Text](S6-Enums)), known `“PerineuriumThicknessModes”` include

            1. `“MEASURED”`: The program determines the average thickness of the
              perineurium using the provided inner and outer boundaries (i.e.,
              `“MaskInputMode”`: `INNER_AND_OUTER_SEPARATE` or
              `INNER_AND_OUTER_COMPILED`). The thickness is determined by
              finding the half the difference in diameters of the circles with
              the same areas as the inner and outer traces of the fascicle.

            2. Linear relationships between fascicle diameter and perineurium
              thickness as stored in `config/system/ci_peri_thickness.json`:

              - `“GRINBERG_2008”`
              - `“PIG_VN_INHOUSE_200523”`
              - `“RAT_VN_INHOUSE_200601”`
              - `“HUMAN_VN_INHOUSE_200601”`

      - `“reshape_nerve”`: The value (String) is the `“ReshapeNerveMode”`
        that tells the program which final nerve profile
        (post-deformation) to use when “deform” is set to `“PHYSICS”`.
        Required.

          - As listed in Enums ([S6 Text](S6-Enums)), known `“ReshapeNerveModes”` include

            1. `“CIRCLE”`: The program creates a circular nerve boundary
                with a preserved cross-sectional area (i.e., for multifascicular nerves/nerves that have epineurium).
            2. `“NONE”`: The program does not deform the nerve boundary (i.e., for monofascicular nerves/nerves that do not have epineurium).

      - `“shrinkage_definition”`: The value (String) is the `“ShrinkageMode”`
        that tells the program how to interpret the "scale"->"shrinkage" parameter, which is provided as a decimal (i.e., 0.2 = 20%).
        Optional, but assumes the mode "LENGTH_FORWARDS if omitted, since this was the original behavior before this mode was added.

          - As listed in Enums ([S6 Text](S6-Enums)), known `“ShrinkageModes”` include

            1. `“LENGTH_BACKWARDS”`: The value for "scale"->"shrinkage" refers to how much the length (e.g., radius, diameter, or perimeter)
               of the nerve cross section was reduced from the fresh tissue to the imaged tissue.
                 - Formula: r_post = r_original * (1-shrinkage)
            2. `“LENGTH_FORWARDS”`: The value for "scale"->"shrinkage" refers to how much the length (e.g., radius, diameter, or perimeter)
               of the nerve cross section increases from the imaged tissue to the fresh tissue.
                 - Formula: r_post = r_original / (1+shrinkage)
            3. `“AREA_BACKWARDS”`: The value for "scale"->"shrinkage" refers to how much the area
               of the nerve cross section was reduced from the fresh tissue to the imaged tissue.
                 - Formula: A_post = A_original * (1-shrinkage)
            4. `“AREA_FORWARDS”`: The value for "scale"->"shrinkage" refers to how much the area
               of the nerve cross section increases from the imaged tissue to the fresh tissue.
                 - Formula: A_post = A_original / (1+shrinkage)

    `“smoothing”`: Smoothing is applied via a dilating the nerve/fascicle boundary by a specified distance value and then shrinking it by that same value.

      - `“nerve_distance”`: Amount (Double) to smooth nerve boundary. Units of micrometers.

      - `“fascicle_distance”`: Amount (Double) to smooth fascicle boundaries (inners and outers). Units of micrometers.

    <!-- end list -->

    `“image_preprocessing”`: Operations applied to the input masks before analysis.

      - `“fill_holes”`: The value (Boolean) indicates whether to fill gaps in the binary masks. If true, any areas of black pixels completely enclosed by white pixels will be turned white.

      - `“object_removal_area”`: The value (Integer) indicates the maximum size of islands to remove from the binary masks. Any isolated islands of white pixels with area less than or equal to object_removal_area will be turned black. Units of pixels.

    <!-- end list -->
    `“morph_count”`: The value (Integer) can be used to set the number of
    intermediately deformed nerve traces between the `boundary_start` and
    `boundary_end` in Deformable ([S13 Text](S13-Python-classes-for-representing-nerve-morphology-(Sample))) if the `“DeformationMode”` is “PHYSCIS”. An
    excessively large number for `morph_count` will slow down the deformation
    process, though a number that is too small could result in fascicles
    “escaping” from the nerve. Optional; if not specified default value is
    36.

    `“deform_ratio”`: The value (Double, range: 0 to 1) can be used to deform
    a nerve if `“DeformationMode”` is `“PHYSICS”` to an intermediately deformed
    `boundary_end`. For example, if the `“ReshapeNerveMode”` is `“CIRCLE”` and
    `deform_ratio = 1`, then the `boundary_end` will be a circle. However, if
    the `“ReshapeNerveMode”` is `“CIRCLE”` and `deform_ratio = 0`, the
    `boundary_end` will be the original nerve trace. A value between 0 and 1
    will result in a partially deformed nerve “on the way” to the final
    circle nerve boundary. Optional, but default value is 1 if not defined
    explicitly. Note: if `deform_ratio` = 0, no changes to the nerve boundary will
    occur, but the physics system will ensure the requirements in `"boundary_separation"` are met.

    `“plot”`: The value (Boolean) determines whether the program
    will generate output plots of sample morphology. If true, plots are generated,
    if false, no plots are generated

    `“plot_folder”`: The value (Boolean) describes plotting behavior (if enabled).
    If true, plots are generated in the folder samples/<sample_index>/plots, if
    false, plots will pop up in a window.

    `"render_deform"`: The value (Boolean) if true, causes the pipeline to generated
    a popup window and display a video of sample deformation as it occurs.

    `“Morphology”`: This JSON Object is used to store information about the
    area and best-fit ellipse information of the nerve and fascicles (outer
    and inners). The user does not set values to these JSON structures, but
    they are a convenient record of the nerve morphometry for assigning
    model attributes based on the anatomy and data analysis. Units:
    micrometer<sup>2</sup> (area); micrometer (length). User does NOT
    manually set these values. Automatically populated. The values `a` and `b` are
    the full width and height of the ellipse major and minor axes, respectively
    (i.e., analogous to diameter rather than radius of a circle).

    `"rotation"`: The value (Double) instructs the pipeline to rotate the nerve about its centroid by the specified amount (units=Degrees).
    This parameter may NOT be used if using an orientation tif image (See [Morphology Files](S11-Morphology-files)).

                        `"num_fascicle_placed"`, a warning is printed to the
                        console instructing user to reduce the number, size,
                        and/or separation of the fascicles.

                  - `“num_fascicle_placed”`: The value (Integer) is the

                        `"num_fascicle_placed"`, a warning is printed to the

                    of different random locations within the nerve that the
                    program will attempt to place a fascicle before skipping
                    it (presumably because it cannot possibly fit in the

                    micrometer) is the lower limit of the uniform
                    distribution for fascicle diameter. Required.

                  - `“upper_fasc_diam”`: The value (Double, units:

                        console instructing user to reduce the number, size,
                        and/or separation of the fascicles.

                  - `“num_fascicle_placed”`: The value (Integer) is the

                        `"num_fascicle_placed"`, a warning is printed to the
                        console instructing user to reduce the number, size,
                        and/or separation of the fascicles.

                    of different random locations within the nerve that the
                    program will attempt to place a fascicle before skipping
                    it (presumably because it cannot possibly fit in the
                    nerve). We recommend using 100+. Required.

                  - `“min_fascicle_separation”`: The value (Double, units:
                    micrometer) determines the minimum distance between
                    fascicle boundaries in the binary mask image that the
                    pipeline will allow without throwing an error. This
                    value controls the separation required between fascicles
                    in the binary mask only. There is a separate parameter
                    for forcing a distance (post-deformation) of the nerve
                    between fascicles and between fascicles and the nerve
                    boundary in `sample.json`. Required.

                  - `“seed”`: The value (Integer) initiates the random number
                    generator. Required.

    constructing the FEM (***Model***). We provide parameterized control
    of model geometry dimensions, cuff electrode, material assignment,
    spatial discretization of the FEM (mesh), and solution.
    Additionally, `model.json` stores meshing and solving statistics.

1.  Properties:

    `"pseudonym"`: This value (String) informs pipeline print statements, allowing
    users to better keep track of the purpose of each configuration file. Optional.

    “modes”

      - `“rho_perineurium”`: The value (String) is the
        `“PerineuriumResistivityMode”` that tells the program how to
        calculate the perineurium conductivity in a frequency and/or
        temperature dependent way. Required.

          - As listed in Enums ([S6 Text](S6-Enums)), known `“PerineuriumResistivityModes”` include

              - `“RHO_WEERASURIYA”`: Program uses mean of circuits C and D
                from Weerasuriya 1984 \[1\] (frog sciatic nerve) ([S28 Text](S28-Definition-of-perineurium)) to adjust
                perineurium conductivity to account for temperature and
                frequency (which are both stored in `model.json`).

              - `“MANUAL”`: Program uses the user-defined value of
                conductivity in “conductivities” (under “perineurium”) with
                no automated correction for frequency.

      - `“cuff_shift”`: The value (String) is the `“CuffShiftMode”` that tells
        the program how to shift the cuff on the nerve ([S17](S17-Creating-custom-preset-cuffs-from-instances-of-part-primitives) and [S19](S19-Cuff-placement-on-nerve) Text). Required.

          - As listed in Enums ([S6 Text](S6-Enums)), known modes include

              - `“NAIVE_ROTATION_MIN_CIRCLE_BOUNDARY”`: Program shifts the
                cuff to within a user-defined distance of the minimum
                bounding circle of the nerve sample. The direction of the
                shift is defined in the preset cuff JSON file ([S17](S17-Creating-custom-preset-cuffs-from-instances-of-part-primitives) and [S19](S19-Cuff-placement-on-nerve) Text). Since this mode does not align the cuff with the sample centroid, orientation masks (`a.tif`) are ignored.

              - `“NAIVE_ROTATION_TRACE_BOUNDARY”`: Program shifts the cuff
                to within a user-defined distance of the nerve trace
                boundary. The direction of the shift is defined in the
                preset cuff JSON file ([S17](S17-Creating-custom-preset-cuffs-from-instances-of-part-primitives) and [S19](S19-Cuff-placement-on-nerve) Text). Since this mode does not align the cuff with the sample centroid, orientation masks (`a.tif`) are ignored.

              - `“AUTO_ROTATION_MIN_CIRCLE_BOUNDARY”`: Program
                shifts/rotates the cuff to within a user-defined distance of
                the minimum bounding circle of the nerve sample to align
                with the Slide’s `“fascicle_centroid”`. The direction of the
                shift is defined in the preset cuff JSON file ([S17](S17-Creating-custom-preset-cuffs-from-instances-of-part-primitives) and [S19](S19-Cuff-placement-on-nerve) Text).

              - `“AUTO_ROTATION_MIN_TRACE_BOUNDARY”`: Program
                shifts/rotates the cuff to within a user-defined distance of
                the nerve trace boundary to align with the Slide’s
                `“fascicle_centroid”`. The direction of the shift is
                defined in the preset cuff JSON file ([S17](S17-Creating-custom-preset-cuffs-from-instances-of-part-primitives) and [S19](S19-Cuff-placement-on-nerve) Text).

              - `“NONE”`: Program keeps both the nerve centroid and cuff
                centered at (x,y) =(0,0) and no cuff rotation is performed ([S17](S17-Creating-custom-preset-cuffs-from-instances-of-part-primitives) and [S19](S19-Cuff-placement-on-nerve) Text). Note: This mode will ignore any supplied orientation image (`a.tif`).

      - `“fiber_z”`: The value (String) is the `“FiberZMode”` that tells the
        program how to seed the NEURON fibers along the length of the FEM.
        In the current implementation of the pipeline, this value must be
        “EXTRUSION”. Required.

      - `“use_ci”`: The value (Boolean), if true, tells the program whether
        to model fascicles (outer) that have a single inner as a sheet
        resistance (i.e., COMSOL “contact impedance”) to simplify the
        meshing of the model. If the value is false, the program will mesh
        the perineurium of all fascicles. Note that fascicles that have more
        than one inner per outer always have a meshed perineurium.

    `“medium”`: The medium JSON Object contains information for the size,
    position, and boundary conditions (i.e., grounded external surface) of
    the proximal (i.e., cylinder containing the full length of nerve and the
    cuff electrode) and distal (i.e., surrounding) medium domains. Required.

      - `“proximal”`: The proximal JSON Object has keys `“distant_ground”`
        (Boolean) that sets the outer surface to ground if true (if false, sets the outer surface to "current conservation", i.e. perfectly insulating), “length”
        (Double, units: micrometer), and “radius” (Double, units:
        micrometer) of a cylindrical medium. The proximal cylindrical medium
        is centered at the origin (x,y,z)=(0,0,0), where the (x,y)-origin is
        the centroid of the nerve sample (i.e., best-fit ellipse of the
        Trace/Nerve), and extends into only the positive z-direction for the
        length of the nerve. A warning is printed to the console if the user
        sets `“distant_ground”` to true AND a distal domain exists (see
        “distal” below). Required.

      - `“distal”`: The distal JSON Object has keys analogous to the
        “proximal” JSON Object, but contains additional keys “exist”
        (Boolean) and “shift” (JSON Object containing key-values pairs
        (Doubles)). The “exist” key allows the user to toggle the existence
        of the distal medium, which is intended to be used to apply coarser
        meshing parameters than in the proximal medium (which contains the
        nerve and cuff electrode along the full length of the nerve). The
        “shift” JSON Object provides control for the user to move the
        distal medium around the proximal medium (x,y,z) (Double, units:
        micrometer). Optional.

    `“inner_interp_tol”`: The value (Double) sets the relative tolerance for
    the representation of the inner trace(s) in COMSOL. When the value is
    set to 0, the curve is jagged, and increasing the value of this
    parameter increases the smoothness of the curve. COMSOL’s “closed curve”
    setting interpolates the points of the curve with continuous first- and
    second-order derivatives. Generally, we find an interpolation tolerance
    in the range of 0.01-0.02 to be appropriate, but the user should check that the
    interpolation tolerance is set correctly for their input nerve sample
    morphology. See the [COMSOL Documentation](https://doc.comsol.com/5.5/doc/com.comsol.help.comsol/comsol_ref_geometry.14.038.html) for more info. Required.

    `“outer_interp_tol”`: The value (Double) sets the relative tolerance for
    the representation of the outer trace(s) in COMSOL. When the value is
    set to 0, the curve is jagged, and increasing the value of this
    parameter increases the smoothness of the curve. COMSOL’s “closed curve”
    setting interpolates the points of the curve with continuous first- and
    second-order derivatives. Generally, we find an interpolation tolerance
    in the range of 0.01-0.02 to be appropriate, but the user should check that the
    interpolation tolerance is set correctly for their input nerve sample
    morphology. See the [COMSOL Documentation](https://doc.comsol.com/5.5/doc/com.comsol.help.comsol/comsol_ref_geometry.14.038.html) for more info. Required.

    `“nerve_interp_tol”`: The value (Double) sets the relative tolerance for
    the representation of the nerve (i.e. epineurium) trace in COMSOL. When the value is
    set to 0, the curve is jagged, and increasing the value of this
    parameter increases the smoothness of the curve. COMSOL’s “closed curve”
    setting interpolates the points of the curve with continuous first- and
    second-order derivatives. Generally, we find an interpolation tolerance
    in the range of 0.001-0.005 to be appropriate, but the user should check that the
    interpolation tolerance is set correctly for their input nerve sample
    morphology. See the [COMSOL Documentation](https://doc.comsol.com/5.5/doc/com.comsol.help.comsol/comsol_ref_geometry.14.038.html) for more info. Required.

    `“cuff”`: The cuff JSON Object contains key-value pairs that define which
    cuff to model on the nerve in addition to how it is placed on the nerve
    (i.e., rotation and translation). If the user would like to loop over
    preset cuff designs, then they must create a ***Model*** (model index)
    for each cuff preset. Required.

      - `“preset”`: The value (String) indicates which cuff to model, selected
        from the list of filenames of the “preset” cuffs in
        `config/system/cuffs/<filename>.json` ([Fig 3A](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1009285.g003) and [S17 Text](S17-Creating-custom-preset-cuffs-from-instances-of-part-primitives)). Required.

      - `“rotate”`: Contains two keys: `“pos_ang”` (automatically populated
        based on “CuffShiftMode”, i.e., “cuff\_shift” parameter in
        ***Model***) and `“add_ang”` (optionally set by user to rotate cuff
        by an additional angle) ([S19 Text](S19-Cuff-placement-on-nerve)).

          - `“pos_ang”` (Double, units: degrees) is calculated by the
            pipeline for the “AUTO” CuffShiftModes ([S19 Text](S19-Cuff-placement-on-nerve)).

          - `“add_ang”` (Double, units: degrees) is user-defined and adds
            additional rotation in the counterclockwise direction. If the
            parameter is not specified, the default value is 0. Optional.

      - `“shift”`: Contains three keys: “x”, “y”, and “z”. Automatically
        calculated based on “CuffShiftMode”.

          - Each key defines the translation of the cuff in the Cartesian
            coordinate system (Double, units: micrometer). The values are
            automatically populated by the pipeline based on the
            `“CuffShiftMode”` (i.e., `“cuff_shift”` parameter within
            “modes”). Origin (x,y) = (0,0) corresponds to the centroid
            of the nerve sample (or fascicle best-fit ellipse of the Trace
            if monofascicular), and shift in z-direction is along the
            proximal medium’s (i.e., the nerve’s) length relative to the
            cuff “Center” (defined in preset JSON file).

    `“min_radius_enclosing_circle”`: The value (Double, units: micrometer)
    is automatically defined in the program with the radius of the minimum
    bounding circle of the sample, which is used for placing the cuff on the
    nerve for certain CuffShiftModes. Automatically calculated.

    `“mesh”`: The mesh JSON Object contains key-value pairs that define
    COMSOL’s meshing parameters (required, user-defined) and resulting
    meshing statistics (automatically calculated).

      - `“quality_measure”`: (String) COMSOL measure to use in calculating mesh quality stats. Options include skewness, maxangle, volcircum, vollength, condition, growth. Default is "vollength" if not specified.

        quadratic = 2). Required.

    <!-- end list -->

      - `“proximal”`: Meshing parameters for the proximal cylindrical domain

            to meshing discretization method (e.g., free tetrahedral
            “ftet”). We recommend free tetrahedral meshes. Required ([S25 Text](S25-Control-of-medium-surrounding-nerve-and-cuff-electrode)).

              - `“im”`: COMSOL indexing prefix (String) (e.g., free
                tetrahedral “ftet”). Required.

              - `“name”`: COMSOL system name (String) for the created mesh
                (e.g., “FreeTet”). Required.

          - `“hmax”`: Maximum element size (Double, units: micrometer). We
            recommend between 1000-4000. Required.

          - `“hmin”`: Minimum element size (Double, units: micrometer). We
            recommend 1. Required.

    All materials functions that are assigned to domains in the part
    primitives are required. If a contact primitive contains a selection for
    recessed domain, the recess material must be assigned even if there is
    no recessed domain in the preset’s parameterized implementation.

      - If the material is defined in place, the JSON Object value is of the
        following structure:

          - `“label”`: Communicates type of material assigned to domains
            (String). The label is used to assign materials to domains ([S27 Text](S27-Defining-and-assigning-materials-in-COMSOL)).
            Required.

          - `“value”`: Required. Material conductivity for isotropic materials
            (String, unit: S/m) OR (String, “anisotropic”) with additional
            keys:

              - `“sigma_x”`, `“sigma_y”`, `“sigma_z”` each with values (String,
                unit: S/m). Required.

    `“solver”`: The solver JSON Object contains key-value pairs to control the
    solver. Required.

      - `“sorder”`: Order of solution shape functions (String) (e.g.,
        quadratic). Required.

    `“solution”`: The solution JSON Object contains key-value pairs to keep
    record of FEM solver processes. Automatically populated.
      - `“sol_time”`: (Double) Time (in milliseconds) elapsed in solving electric currents.

      - `“name”`: Solver identity (String) used to solve electric currents (i.e., COMSOL version).

## sim.json

1.  Named file: `config/user/sims/<sim_index>.json`

1.  Purpose: Instructs the pipeline on which user-defined parameters to
    use in constructing NEURON simulation directories (***Sim***). We
    provide parameterized control of cuff electrode contact weighting,
    fiber model and placement in the FEM, extracellular stimulation
    waveform, intracellular stimulation, flags to indicate which
    outputs to save (e.g., state variables of channel gating mechanisms,
    transmembrane potential, intracellular stimulation), and stimulation
    threshold-finding protocol ([S22](S22-Simulation-protocols), [S32](S32-NEURON-Wrapper.hoc), and [S33](S33-Data-analysis-tools) Text).

1.  Properties:

    `"pseudonym"`: This value (String) informs pipeline print statements, allowing
    users to better keep track of the purpose of each configuration file. Optional.

    `“n_dimensions”`: The value (Integer) is the number of parameters in
    ***Sim*** for which a list is provided rather than a single value. The
    user sets the number of parameters they are looping over (e.g., if
    looping over waveform pulse width and fiber diameter, `n_dimensions =
    2`). We included this control to prevent the user from accidentally
    creating unintended NEURON simulations. The pipeline will only loop over
    the first n-dimensions. Required.

    `“active_srcs”`: The value is a JSON Object containing key-value pairs of
    contact weightings for preset cuffs. Each value (`List[List[Double]]`)
    is the contact weighting used to make extracellular potentials inputs
    to NEURON simulations. The order of weights matches the order of parts 
    containing point current sources. The values should not exceed +/-1 in magnitude,
    otherwise an error is thrown. For monopolar cuff electrodes, the value
    should be either +1 or -1. For cuff electrodes with more than one
    contact (2+), the sum of weightings should be +1, -1, or 0. If the
    preset cuff is not a key in `active_srcs`, the list of contact weightings
    for the “default” key is used. Required. The potentials/ for a single
    fiber are calculated in the following way for the default weighting:

    `"default": [[1, -1]]` // [[weight<sub>1</sub> (for src 1 on),
    weight<sub>2</sub> (for src 2 on)]]

    ![f2]

    ![f3]

    The value of potentials/ is applied to a model fiber in NEURON
    multiplied by the stimulation amplitude, which is either from a list of
    finite amplitudes or a binary search for thresholds ([S22 Text](S22-Simulation-protocols))

    ![f4]

    `“fibers”`: The value is a JSON Object containing key-value pairs that
    define how potentials are sampled in the FEM for application as
    extracellular potentials in NEURON (i.e., the Cartesian coordinates of
    the midpoint for each compartment (i.e., section or segment) along the
    length of the fiber). Required.

      - `“mode”`: The value (String) is the “FiberGeometry” mode that tells
        the program which fiber geometries to simulate in NEURON ([S21](S21-Implementation-of-NEURON-fiber-models) and [S32](S32-NEURON-Wrapper.hoc) Text). Required.

          - As listed in Enums ([S6 Enums](S6-Enums)), known modes include

              - `“MRG_DISCRETE”` (published MRG fiber model)

              - `“MRG_INTERPOLATION”` (interpolates the discrete diameters
                from published MRG fiber models)

              - `“TIGERHOLM”` (published C-fiber model)

              - `“SUNDT”` (published C-fiber model)

              - `“RATTAY”` (published C-fiber model)

          - For a user to simulate a novel fiber type using the pipeline,
            they must define the spatial discretization of points within the
            `config/system/fiber_z.json` file to match the dimensions of the
            fiber compartments connected in NEURON. The “FiberGeometry” mode
            and parameters in the “fibers” JSON Object in ***Sim*** must
            match the keys in `config/system/fiber_z.json` to select and
            define a fiber type (e.g., MRG requires specification of fiber
            “diameters”).

      - `“xy_trace_buffer”`: The value (Double, units: micrometer) indicates
        the minimum required distance between the (x,y)-coordinates of a
        given fiber and the inner’s boundary. Since the domain boundaries
        are modeled in COMSOL as an interpolation curve, the exact
        morphology boundary coordinates read into COMSOL will be very close
        to (but not exactly equal to) those used in Python to seed fiber
        locations. To protect against instances of fibers falling within the
        nerve boundary traces in the exact Python traces, but not in
        COMSOL’s interpolation of those traces, we provided this
        parameter. Required.

      - `“z_parameters”`: The value is a JSON Object containing key-value
        pairs to instruct the system in seeding fibers along the length of
        the nerve. Required.

          - `“diameter”` The value can take multiple forms to define the fiber diameter that the user is simulating in NEURON ([S21](S21-Implementation-of-NEURON-fiber-models) and [S32](S32-NEURON-Wrapper.hoc) Text). The value can control simulation of either fixed diameter fibers or fibers chosen from a distribution of diameters (note simulating a distribution of fiber diameters is only compatible with `“MRG_INTERPOLATION”`myelinated or unmyelinated fiber types, not `“MRG_DISCRETE”`). In ***Sim***, only one mode of defining fiber diameters can be used. Required.
             - Fixed diameter: the value (Double or List[Double], units: micrometer) is the diameter of the fiber models. If using with `“MRG_DISCRETE”`, the diameters must be members of the set of published diameters.
             - Distribution of diameters: the value is a dictionary of key-value pairs to define the distribution of diameters based on the `“mode”` parameter, which can be either `“TRUNCNORM”` or `“UNIFORM”`.
                 - `“TRUNCNORM”`
                    - `“mode”`: “TRUNCNORM” (String). Required.
                    - `“mu”`: The value (Double, units micrometer) is the mean diameter of the truncated normal distribution. Required.
                    - `“std”`: The value (Double, units micrometer) is the diameter standard deviation of the truncated normal distribution. Required.
                    - `“n_std_limit”`: The value (Double) is the number of standard deviations from the mean to bound the truncated normal distribution. Required.
                    - `“seed”`: The value (Integer, unitless) seeds the random number generator before sampling fiber diameters.
                 - `“UNIFORM”`
                    - `“mode”`: `UNIFORM”` (String). Required.
                    - `“upper”`: The value (Double, units micrometer) is the upper limit on the distribution of diameters. Required.
                    - `“lower”`: The value (Double, units micrometer) is the lower limit on the distribution of diameters. Required.
                    - `“seed”`: The value (Integer) seeds the random number generator before sampling fiber diameters.

          - `“min”`: the value (Double or List\[Double\], units: micrometer)
            is the distal extent of the seeded fiber along the length of the
            nerve closer to z = 0. Optional: if min and max are not both
            provided then the fiber length is assumed to be the proximal
            medium length (see `model.json`).

          - `“max”`: The value (Double or List\[Double\] , units: micrometer)
            is the distal extent of the seeded fiber along the length of the
            nerve closer to z = length of the proximal medium (as defined in
            `model.json`, the length of the nerve). Optional: if min and max

            of the node-node length (myelinated fibers) or segment length
            (unmyelinated fibers) that the center coordinate of the fiber is
            shifted along the z-axis from the longitudinal center of the
            proximal medium. If the value is "random", the offset will
            be randomly selected between +/- 0.5 section/segment length; to
            avoid the randomized longitudinal placement, set the offset
            value to ‘0’ for no offset.

          - `“absolute_offset”`: The value (Double) is the distance (micrometers) that the center coordinate of the fiber is
            shifted along the z-axis from the longitudinal center of the
            proximal medium. This value is additive with `"offset"`. Note that the shift is with respect to the model center. If a negative value is passed, the fiber will be shifted in the -z direction.

            before any random offsets are created. Required only if “offset”

              - `“angle_offset”`: The value (Double, either degrees or
                radians depending on next parameter,
                `“angle_offset_is_in_degrees”`) sets the direction of
                the first spoke in the wheel. The rest of the spokes are

                true, tells the program to interpret `“angle_offset”` as

                radians. Required.

          - `“EXPLICIT”`: The mode looks for a `“<explicit_index>.txt”` file in the user created directory (`samples/<sample_index>/explicit_fibersets`) for user-specified fiber (x,y)-coordinates (see `config/templates/explicit.txt`). Note, this file is only required if the user is using the `“EXPLICIT”` `“FiberXYMode”`. An error is thrown if any explicitly defined coordinates are not inside any inners.

                        in an inner. Required only if `“top_down”` is true.

                  - If `“top_down”` is false (i.e., bottom-up), the program
                    determines the number of fibers per unit area (i.e.,
                    fiber density) with `“target_number”` and the area of the
                    smallest inner. If the number of fibers in an inner is
                    more than the `“maximum_number”`, then the maximum number
                    is used.

                      - `“target_number”`: The value (Integer) is the number
                        of fibers placed in the smallest inner. Required

                        maximum number of fibers placed in the largest

    The user must also provide ***one*** of the
    following JSON Objects containing “WaveformMode”-specific parameters.
    The user can only loop parameters for one type of waveform in a
    ***Sim***.

    Note: the “digits” parameter for the following “WaveformModes” sets the
    precision of the unscaled current amplitude. For waveforms that are only
    ever +/-1 and 0 (e.g., `MONOPHASIC_PULSE_TRAIN`, `BIPHASIC_FULL_DUTY`,
    `BIPHASIC_PULSE_TRAIN`), the user can represent the waveform faithfully
    with 1 digit of precision. However, for waveforms that assume
    intermediate values (e.g., `SINUSOID`,
    `BIPHASIC_PULSE_TRAIN_Q_BALANCED_UNEVEN_PW`, `EXPLICIT`) more digits
    of precision may be required to achieve numerical accuracy. An excessive
    number of digits of precision will increase computational load and waste
    storage resources.

    Note: if one of the parameter values in the `“WaveformMode”` JSON Object
    is a list, then there are `n_sim/` folders created for as many waveforms
    as parameter values in the list. If more than one parameter value is a
    list, then there are `n_sim/` folders created for each combination of
    waveform parameters among the lists (i.e., the Cartesian product).

        may be spaced by a gap defined by `“inter_phase”`. This waveform is a

        two phases can have different durations, as defined by
        `“pulse_width_1”` and `“pulse_width_2”`. Further, the two phases

      - `“dt_initSS”`: The value (Double, units: milliseconds) is the time
        step (usually larger than “dt” in “global” JSON Object (see above))
        used to reach steady state in the NEURON simulations before starting
        the simulation proper. Required.

      - `“amplitudes”`: The value (List\[Double\], units: mA) contains
        extracellular current amplitudes to simulate. Required if running
        `“FINITE_AMPLITUDES”` for `“NeuronRunMode”`.

      - `“threshold”`: The JSON Object contains key-value pairs to define what
        constitutes threshold being achieved. Required for threshold finding
        protocols (i.e., `“ACTIVATION_THRESHOLDS”` and `“BLOCK_THRESHOLDS”`)
        only.

          - `“value”`: The value (Double, units: mV) is the transmembrane
            potential that must be crossed with a rising edge for the NEURON
            code to count an action potential. Required for threshold
            finding protocols (i.e., `“ACTIVATION_THRESHOLDS”` and
            `“BLOCK_THRESHOLDS”`) only.

          - `“n_min_aps”`: The value (Integer) is the number of action
            potentials that must be detected for the amplitude to be
            considered above threshold. Required for threshold finding
            protocols (i.e., `“ACTIVATION_THRESHOLDS”` and
            `“BLOCK_THRESHOLDS”`) only.

          - `“ap_detect_location”`: The value (Double) is the location
            (range 0 to 1, i.e., 0.9 is 90% of the fiber length in the
            +z-direction) where action potentials are detected for threshold
            finding protocols (i.e., `“ACTIVATION_THRESHOLDS”` or
            `“BLOCK_THRESHOLDS”`). Note: If using fiber models with passive
            end nodes, the user should not try to detect action potentials
            at either end of the fiber. Required for threshold finding
            protocols (i.e., `“ACTIVATION_THRESHOLDS”` and
            `“BLOCK_THRESHOLDS”`) only.

      - `“bounds_search”`: the value (JSON Object) contains key-value pairs
        to define how to search for upper and lower bounds in binary search
        algorithms ([S22 Text](S22-Simulation-protocols)). Required for threshold finding protocols (i.e.,
        `“ACTIVATION_THRESHOLDS”` and `“BLOCK_THRESHOLDS”`).

          - `“mode”`: the value (String) is the `“SearchAmplitudeIncrementMode”`
            that tells the program how to change the initial upper and lower
            bounds for the binary search; the bounds are adjusted
            iteratively until the initial upper bound (i.e., “top”)
            activates/blocks and until the initial lower bound does not
            activate/block, before starting the binary search ([S22 Text](S22-Simulation-protocols)). Required.

              - As listed in Enums ([S6 Text](S6-Enums)), known `“SearchAmplitudeIncrementModes”`
                include:

                  - `“ABSOLUTE_INCREMENT”`: If the current upper bound does
                    not activate/block, increase the upper bound by a fixed
                    “step” amount (e.g., 0.001 mA). If the lower bound
                    activates/blocks, decrease the lower bound by a fixed
                    “step” amount (e.g., 0.001 mA).

                  - `“PERCENT_INCREMENT”`: If the upper bound does not
                    activate/block, increase the upper bound by a “step”
                    percentage (e.g., 10 for 10%). If the lower bound
                    activates/blocks, decrease the lower bound by a “step”
                    percentage (e.g., 10 for 10%).

          - `“top”`: The value (Double) is the upper-bound stimulation
            amplitude first tested in a binary search for thresholds.
            Required.

          - `“bottom”`: The value (Double) is the lower-bound stimulation
            amplitude first tested in a binary search for thresholds.
            Required.

          - `“step”`: the value (Double) is the incremental increase/decrease
            of the upper/lower bound in the binary search. Required.

              - If `“ABSOLUTE_INCREMENT”`, the value (Double, unit: mA) is an
                increment in milliamps.

              - If `“PERCENT_INCREMENT”`, the value (Double, units: %) is a
                percentage (e.g., 10 is 10%).

          - `“scout”`: The value (JSONObject) is a set of key-value pairs specifying a previously run "scout"
            Sim for the same Sample. Use this feature to reduce CPU time required for many
            fibers placed in the same inner for a new Sim or Model. If this key is present, ASCENT will
            look for thresholds in n_sim folders in your ASCENT_NSIM_EXPORT_PATH
            (i.e., the path you set in config/system/env.json) for fiber0 of each
            inner for each n_sim. The program will load this threshold value and use
            it as a starting point for the threshold bounds for each inner in your new Sim.
            The upper- and lower-bounds in the binary search will be "bounds_search" -> "step" %
            higher and lower, respectively, of the scout Sim's fiber0 threshold. All parameters except
            fiber location (i.e., "fibers" -> "xy_location" in Sim) must match between
            the scout Sim and the current Sim, since the n_sim indices must match between the
            scout Sim and current Sim. If this key ("scout") is present, the program will ignore
            the threshold bounds "top" and "bottom" in "protocol" -> "bounds_search"
            (Unless the specified scout Sim is not found, in which case
            "top" and "bottom" will be used). Optional.

              - `"model"`: The value (Integer) indicates which model index to use for the scout Sim. Required if `"scout"` is used.

              - `"sim"`: The value (Integer) indicates which sim index to use fo the scout Sim (can be the current Sim's index). Required if `"scout"` is used.

    <!-- end list -->

      - `“termination_criteria”`: Required for threshold finding protocols
        (i.e., `“ACTIVATION_THRESHOLDS”` and `“BLOCK_THRESHOLDS”`) ([S22 Text](S22-Simulation-protocols)).

          - `“mode”`: The value (String) is the `“TerminationCriteriaMode”` that
            tells the program when the upper and lower bound have converged
            on a solution of appropriate precision. Required.

              - As listed in Enums ([S6 Text](S6-Enums)), known `“TerminationCriteriaModes”`
                include:

                  - `“ABSOLUTE_DIFFERENCE”`: If the upper bound and lower
                    bound in the binary search are within a fixed
                    “tolerance” amount (e.g., 0.001 mA), the upper bound
                    value is threshold.

                      - `“tolerance”`: The value (Double) is the absolute
                        difference between upper and lower bound in the
                        binary search for finding threshold (unit: mA).
                        Required.

                  - `“PERCENT_DIFFERENCE”`: If the upper bound and lower
                    bound in the binary search are within a relative
                    “percent” amount (e.g., 1%), the upper bound value is
                    threshold. This mode is generally recommended as the
                    `ABSOLUTE_DIFFERENCE` approach requires adjustment of the
                    “tolerance” to be suitable for different threshold
                    magnitudes.

                      - `“percent”`: The value (Double) is the percent
                        difference between upper and lower bound in the
                        binary search for finding threshold (e.g., 1 is 1%).
                        Required.

    `“supersampled_bases”`: Optional. Required only for either generating or
    reusing super-sampled bases. This can be a memory efficient process by
    eliminating the need for long-term storage of the bases/ COMSOL `*.mph`
    files. Control of `“supersampled_bases”` belongs in ***Sim*** because the
    (x,y)-fiber locations in the nerve are determined by ***Sim***. The
    potentials are sampled densely along the length of the nerve at
    (x,y)-fiber locations once so that in a future pipeline run different
    fiber types can be simulated at the same location in the nerve cross
    section without loading COMSOL files into memory.

      - `“generate”`: The value (Boolean) indicates if the program will create
        super-sampled fiber coordinates and super-sampled bases (i.e.,
        sampled potentials from COMSOL). Required only if generating
        `ss_bases/`.

      - `“use”`: The value (Boolean) if true directs the program to
        interpolate the super-sampled bases to create the extracellular
        potential inputs for NEURON. If false, the program will sample along
        the length of the COMSOL FEM at the coordinates explicitly required
        by “fibers”. Required only if generating `ss_bases/`.

      - `“dz”`: The value (Double, units: micrometer) is the spatial sampling
        of the super-sampled bases. Required only if generating `ss_bases/`.

      - `“source_sim”`: The value (Integer) is the ***Sim*** index that
        contains the super-sampled bases. If the user sets both “generate”
        and “use” to true, then the user should indicate the index of the
        current ***Sim*** here. Required only if generating `ss_bases/`.

## query\_criteria.json

1.  Named file: `config/user/query_criteria/<query criteria
    index>.json`

1.  Purpose: Used to guide the Query class’s searching algorithm in the
    `run()` and `_match()` methods. This is used for pulling ***Sample***,
    ***Model***, or ***Sim*** indices for data analysis. The
    `query_criteria.json` dictates if a given ***Sample***, ***Model***,
    or ***Sim*** fit the user’s restricted parameter values ([S33 Text](S33-Data-analysis-tools)).

1.  Syntax:
    ```
    {
      "partial_matches": Boolean,
      "include_downstream": Boolean,
      "sample": { // can be empty, null, or omitted
      },
      "model": { // can be empty, null, or omitted
      },
      "sim": { // can be empty, null, or omitted
      },
      "indices": {
        "sample": null, Integer, or [Integer, ...],
        "model": null, Integer, or [Integer, ...],
        "sim": null, Integer, or [Integer, ...]
      }
    }
    ```
1.  Properties:

    `“partial_matches”`: The value (Boolean) indicates whether Query should
    return configuration indices for ***Sample***, ***Model***, or ***Sim***
    that are a partial match (i.e., a subset of the parameters were found,
    but not all).

    `“include_downstream"`: The value (Boolean) indicates whether Query
    should return indices of downstream (***Sample*** \> ***Model*** \>
    ***Sim***) configurations that exist if match criteria are not provided
    for them.

    `“sample”`: The value is a JSON Object that mirrors the path to the
    parameters of interest in ***Sample*** and their value(s).

    `“model”`: The value is a JSON Object that mirrors the path to the
    parameters of interest in ***Model*** and their value(s).

    `“sim”`: The value is a JSON Object that mirrors the path to the
    parameters of interest in ***Sim*** and their value(s).

    `“indices”`: 

      - `“sample”`: The value (null, Integer, or \[Integer, …\]) for
        explicitly desired ***Sample*** indices

      - `“model”`: The value (null, Integer, or \[Integer, …\]) for explicitly
        desired ***Model*** indices

      - `“sim”`: The value (null, Integer, or \[Integer, …\]) for explicitly
        desired ***Sim*** indices

    Note: you can have BOTH lists of desired ***Sample***, ***Model***, and
    ***Sim*** indices AND search criteria in one `query_criteria.json`.

1.  Example:
    ```
    {
      "partial_matches": true,
      "include_downstream": true,
      "sample": {
        "sample": "Rat16-3"
      },
      "model": {
        "medium": {
          "proximal": {
            "length": [1000, 2000]
          }
        }
      },
      "sim": null,
      "indices": {
        "sample": null,
        "model": null,
        "sim": null
      }
    }
    ```

## env.json

1.  Named file: `config/system/env.json`

1.  Purpose: The file contains key-value pairs for paths. The file can
    be automatically populated by running `env_setup.py` ([S2 Text](S2-Installation)). Note that we
    have prepended all of the keys in this file with “ASCENT” because
    these key-value pairs are directly stored as environment variables,
    so the “ASCENT” key distinguishes these pairs from other paths that
    may be present on your computer.

1.  Syntax: To declare this entity in `config/system/env.json`, use the
    following syntax:
    ```
    {
      "ASCENT_COMSOL_PATH": String,
      "ASCENT_JDK_PATH": String,
      "ASCENT_PROJECT_PATH": String,
      "ASCENT_NSIM_EXPORT_PATH": String
    }
    ```
1.  Properties:

    `“ASCENT_COMSOL_PATH”`: The value (String) is the path for your local
    COMSOL installation.
    `“ASCENT_JDK_PATH”`: The value (String) is the path for your local Java
    JDK installation.
    `“ASCENT_PROJECT_PATH”`: The value (String) is the path for your local
    ASCENT repository.
    `“ASCENT_NSIM_EXPORT_PATH”`: The value (String) is the path where the
    pipeline will save NEURON simulation directories to submit.

1.  Example:

    <!-- end list -->

      - Windows:
    ```
    {
      "ASCENT_COMSOL_PATH": "C:\\Program Files\\COMSOL\\COMSOL55\\Multiphysics",
      "ASCENT_JDK_PATH": "C:\\Program Files\\Java\\jdk1.8.0_221\\bin",
      "ASCENT_PROJECT_PATH": "D:\\Documents\\ascent",
      "ASCENT_NSIM_EXPORT_PATH": "D:\\Documents\\ascent\\submit"
    }
    ```
      - MacOS
    ```
    {
      "ASCENT_COMSOL_PATH": "/Applications/COMSOL55/Multiphysics ",
      "ASCENT_JDK_PATH":
      "/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.8.0_221.jdk/Contents/Home/bin/",
      "ASCENT_PROJECT_PATH": "/Users/ericmusselman/Documents/ascent",
      "ASCENT_NSIM_EXPORT_PATH": "/Users/ericmusselman/Documents/ascent/submit"
    }
    ```

## exceptions.json

1.  Named file: `config/system/exceptions.json`

1.  Purpose: The file contains a list of JSON Objects, one for each
    documented pipeline exception. Note that this file is a single large
    Array, so it is wrapped in square brackets, as opposed to all other
    JSON files, which are wrapped in curly braces.

1.  Syntax:  To declare this entity in `config/system/env.json`, use the
    following syntax:
    ```
    [
      {
        "code": Integer,
        "text": String
      },
      ...
    ]
    ```
1.  Properties:

    `“code”`: The value (Integer) is an identifier that enables easy reference
    to a specific exception using Exceptionable’s
    `self.throw(<code_index>)`. This value must be unique because the
    Exeptionable class uses this value to find any given exception. We
    suggest that you increment the code with each successive exception (akin
    to indexing), but any number will work as long as its value is unique.

    `“text”`: The value (String) is a message to the user explaining why the
    pipeline failed.

1.  Example:
    ```
    [
      {
        "code": 0,
        "text": "Invalid code (out of bounds, starting at index 1)."
      },
      ...
    ]
    ```

## materials.json

1.  Named file: `config/system/materials.json`

1.  Purpose: Stores default material and tissue properties in the
    pipeline for use in the 3D FEM.

1.  Syntax: To declare this entity in `config/system/materials.json`, use
    the following syntax:
    ```
    {
      "conductivities": {
        "endoneurium": { // example syntax for anisotropic medium
          "value": "anisotropic",
          "sigma_x": String,
          "sigma_y": String,
          "sigma_z": String,
          "unit": "String",
          "references": {
            "1": String,
            ...,
            "n": String
          }
        },
        "epineurium": { // example syntax for isotropic medium
          "value": "String",
          "unit": "String",
          "references": {
            "1": String,
            ...,
            "n": String
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```
1.  Properties:

    `“<material>”`: The value is a JSON Object containing the conductivity
    value and units as Strings. Though using strings may seem odd for
    storing conductivity values, we do this because we read them directly
    into COMSOL to define materials, and COMSOL expects a string (which it
    evaluates as expression).

      - `“value”`: The conductivity of the material (if not “anisotropic”, the
        value must be in units S/m). If the value is “anisotropic”, the
        system is expecting additional keys for the values in each Cartesian
        direction:

          - `“sigma_x”`: The value (String) is the conductivity in the
            x-direction (unit: S/m)

          - `“sigma_y”`: The value (String) is the conductivity in the
            y-direction (unit: S/m)

          - `“sigma\_z”`:  The value (String) is the conductivity in the
            z-direction (unit: S/m)

      - `“unit”`: The unit of the associated conductivity in square brackets
        (must be “\[S/m\]”)

      - `"references"`: The value (Dictionary) contains citations to the source of the material conductivity used. The contents are non-functional (i.e., they are not used in any of the code), but they serve as a point of information reference for good bookkeeping. Each reference used is assigned its own key-value pair (Optional).

    <!-- end list -->

1.  Example:

    <!-- end list -->

      - See: `config/system/materials.json` to see all built-in material
        definitions, which the user may add to.

    ```
    {
      "conductivities": {
        "endoneurium": {
          "value": "anisotropic",
          "sigma_x": "1/6",
          "sigma_y": "1/6",
          "sigma_z": "1/1.75",
          "unit": "[S/m]"
        },
        "epineurium": {
          "value": "1/6.3",
          "unit": "[S/m]"
        }
      }
    }
    ```

    Note: Perineurium can be represented in the pipeline as either a meshed
    domain with a finite thickness or as a thin layer approximation, but the
    conductivity value used for either method is defined in `materials.json`
    unless the `“PerineuriumResistivityMode”` is `“MANUAL”` and the conductivity
    is defined explicitly in ***Model*** ([](S28-Definition-of-perineurium)).

## ci\_peri\_thickness.json

1.  Named file: `config/system/ci_peri_thickness.json`

1.  Purpose: The file stores `“PerineuriumThicknessMode”` definitions that
    are referenced in `sample.json` (`“ci_perineurium_thickness”`) for
    assigning perineurium thickness values to fascicles for a mask of
    inners if `“ci_perineurium_thickness”` is not specified as "MEASURED".
    The calculated thickness may be explicitly built in the FEM geometry
    and meshed (i.e., if `“use_ci”` in ***Model*** is false) or may only
    be used for calculating the contact impedance if modeling the
    perineurium with a thin layer approximation ([S14](S14-Creating-sample-specific-nerve-morphologies-in-COMSOL) and [S28](S28-Definition-of-perineurium) Text).

1.  Syntax:
    ```
    {
      "ci_perineurium_thickness_parameters": {
        "GRINBERG_2008": {
          "a": Double,
          "b": Double
        },
        ...
      }
    }
    ```
1.  Properties:

    `“<PerineuriumThicknessMode>”`: JSON Object that contains key-value
    pairs defining the relationship between fascicle diameter (micrometers)
    and perineurium thickness. Required.

      - `“a”`: Value (Double, units: µm/µm) as in thickness = a\*x + b

      - `“b”`: Value (Double, units: µm) as in thickness = a\*x + b

    <!-- end list -->

1.  Example:

    <!-- end list -->

      - See: `config/system/ci_peri_thickness.json` to see all built-in
        `PerineuriumThicknessMode` relationships.

## mesh\_dependent\_model.json

1.  Named file: `config/system/mesh_dependent_model.json`

1.  Purpose: This file is not to be changed unless a user adds new
    parameters to ***Model***. The use of this file happens behind the
    scenes. The file informs the `ModelSearcher` class ([S26 Text](S26-Java-utility-classes)) if two model
    configurations constitute a "mesh match" (i.e., that the mesh from a
    previously solved and identical model can be recycled). Note that if
    you modify the structure of `model.json`, the pipeline expects this
    file’s structure to be changed as well. If the Boolean for a
    parameter is true, then the parameter values between two
    ***Models*** must be identical to constitute a "mesh match". If the Boolean for a parameter is
    false, then the parameter values between the two ***Models*** can be
    different and still constitute a "mesh match". The process of
    identifying "mesh matches" is automated and is only performed if the
    `“recycle_meshes”` parameter in ***Run*** is true.

1.  Syntax: To declare this entity in
    `config/system/mesh_dependent_model.json`, use the following syntax:

    <!-- end list -->

      - The same key-value structure pair as in ***Model***, but the values
        are of type Boolean

          - true: The parameter values between the two ***Model***
            configurations must be identical to constitute a "mesh match".

          - false: The parameter values between the two ***Model***
            configurations can be different and still constitute a "mesh match".

    <!-- end list -->

1.  Properties:

    See: `model.json`

1.  Example:

    See: `config/system/mesh_dependent_model.json`

      - Note: The user should not need to change this file unless adding new
        parameters to ***Model*** for expanded/modified pipeline
        functionality.
