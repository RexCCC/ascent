# Installation
## Installing commercial software dependencies

It is *highly* recommended that you use a distribution of Anaconda/Miniconda with ASCENT. However, advanced users who wish to use another Python distribution may.

First, these software packages must be manually installed:
* [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)/[Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) We recommend that you install Miniconda (Miniconda is a stripped down version of Anaconda; Anaconda is optional for intermediate users). If you alread have an existing installation, there is no need to reinstall.
    - Recommended: Select add to path
    - Recommended: Select "Install for individual user"
    - https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html
    - https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual
* [Java SE Development Kit 8 (1.8)](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/javase-jdk8-downloads.html) (need to register for a free account)
    - [https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/javase-jdk8-downloads.html](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/javase-jdk8-downloads.html)
* [Homebrew](https://docs.brew.sh/Installation) (Mac and Linux only)
    - ```/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"```
    - ```brew install wget```
* [COMSOL 5.4 or newer](https://www.comsol.com/product-download) (requires purchase of license; only based package needed, which includes the COMSOL Java API)
    - Once COMSOL is installed, alter 'File System Access' permissions via  File → Preferences → Security → Methods and Java Libraries → File System Access → All Files.
    - Open the COMSOL Server and log in with a username and password of your choosing (arbitrary and not needed thereafter). This can be done by navigating to the bin/ directory in the COMSOL installation and running ```comsolmphserver``` (Windows) or ```./comsol server``` (MacOS/Linux).
    - [https://www.comsol.com/product-download](https://www.comsol.com/product-download)
* [NEURON 7.6](https://neuron.yale.edu/ftp/neuron/versions/v7.6/) (newer versions have been released, but compatibility has yet to be confirmed; choose appropriate installer depending on operating system; install auxiliary software as prompted by NEURON installer)
    - [https://neuron.yale.edu/ftp/neuron/versions/v7.6/](https://neuron.yale.edu/ftp/neuron/versions/v7.6/)
    - If having issues with the NEURON installation, try running the compatibility troubleshooter.

In this stage of development, all programs/commands are run from a command line environment on both MacOS/Linux and Windows operating systems (Bash terminal for MacOS/Linux, Powershell for Windows). For users less familiar with this environment and for the quickest setup, it is suggested that the user install the package management system [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) or [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) (if using MacOS, choose .pkg for ease of use).

Note that compiling NEURON files (when submitting sims) requires that the following packages be installed and on your path (Mac and Linux ONLY):
    - openmpi-2.0.0
    - libreadlines.so.6

If using MacOS to run local NEURON simulations, it may be necessary to install the Xcode Command Line Tools via ```xcode-select --install```, as well as [Xquartz](https://www.xquartz.org/releases/XQuartz-2.7.11.html).

Users may also download a text editor or integrated development environment (IDE) of their choosing to view/edit code (e.g., [Atom](https://atom.io/), [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/)). For Java code, full autocomplete functionality requires adding both the path to the COMSOL installation ending in `plugins` as well as the path ```<ASCENT_PATH>/bin/json-20190722.jar``` to the list of available libraries (usually from within the IDE’s project settings).

## Installing ASCENT

1. First, download or clone the SPARC ASCENT pipeline from [GitHub](https://github.com/wmglab-duke/ascent) to a desired location that will be referenced in step 3. Downloading is a much simpler process than cloning via Git, but does not easily allow for you to get the most recent updates/bug fixes, nor does it allow you to suggest new features/changes. If you are interested in either of these features, you should clone via Git rather than downloading.
    * Downloading: Click the [download](https://github.com/wmglab-duke/ascent/archive/refs/heads/master.zip) button on GitHub and choose the location to which you would like to save. Note that you will need to extract the files, as they will be downloaded in a compressed format. When presented with a choice of compression format, ".zip" is a safe choice that most computers will be able to extract.
    * Cloning via Git:
        1. You must first have an account with GitHub, and if you have been granted special permissions to the code repository, you must use the email address to which those permissions were granted.
        2. If you have not already done so, add an SSH key to your account (see instructions for [GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/connecting-to-github-with-ssh)). This is a required standard authentication method.
        3. In a Miniconda (or Git, for advanced users) command line environment, navigate to the location to where you would like to clone the code repository (see instructions for navigating the file system from the command line for [Mac or Linux](https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/navigating-linux-filesystem) and [Windows](https://blogs.umass.edu/Techbytes/2014/11/14/file-navigation-with-windows-command-prompt/)).
        4. Clone the repository (see instructions for [GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository)).
        5. For more information on using Git, check out the [official documentation](https://git-scm.com/doc).

2. Next, install ASCENT dependencies:
    * Windows: Open the Anaconda Powershell Prompt from the Windows Start Menu as Administrator, and use cd to navigate to the root directory of the pipeline. Then, run ```python run install```. Note: If reinstalling ASCENT after having changed your Anaconda/Miniconda installation, it may be necessary to delete the `#region conda initialize` block from `C:\Users\<username>\Documents\WindowsPowerShell\profile.ps1` in order to use Anaconda Powershell Prompt.
    * MacOS/Linux: Open Anaconda Prompt and use cd to navigate to the root directory of the pipeline. Then, run ```python run install```.
    * For advanced users using their own (non-conda) Python distribution:
      - From the ascent root directory execute ```python run install --no-conda```
      - From the ascent root directory execute ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
      - This method is highly discouraged as newer versions of packages/Python could potentially break ASCENT or introduce unexpected bugs

After confirming that you are in the correct directory, the script will install the required Python packages: Pillow \[1\], NumPy \[2\], Shapely \[3\], Matplotlib \[4\], PyClipper \[5\], pygame \[6\], QuantiPhy \[7\], OpenCV \[8\], PyMunk \[9\], and SciPy \[10\], pandas \[11\], and OpenPyXL \[12\]. It is crucial that all of the packages are installed successfully (check for "successfully installed" for each package). The installation script will also create a shortcut to the newly configured ASCENT Conda "environment" on your project path, which can be used for running the pipeline.

3. Then, configure the environment variables. This step may be completed several ways, described below.
    * Recommended Setup: Open Anaconda prompt, navigate to the ASCENT root directory, and  execute ```python run env_setup```. You will be prompted for the following paths:
      - ASCENT_COMSOL_PATH: Path to the COMSOL installation, ending in the directory name “Multiphysics”, as seen in the template and S7.
      - ASCENT_JDK_PATH: Path to the JDK 1.8 installation, ending in ```bin```, as seen in the template and S7. Hint: This is the correct path if the directory contains many executables (for Windows: java.exe, etc.; MacOS/Linux: java, etc.).
      - ASCENT_PROJECT_PATH: Path to the root directory of the pipeline, as chosen for step 1.
      - ASCENT_NSIM_EXPORT_PATH: Path to the export location for NEURON “simulation” directories. This path only depends on on the user's desired file system organization.
    * Manual Setup: Copy the file ```config/templates/env.json``` into ```config/system/env.json``` (new file). This file holds important paths for software used by the pipeline (see env.json in S6 and S7). Then, edit each of the four values as specified below. Use ```\\``` in Windows and ```/``` in MacOS/Linux operating systems. Note that the file separators are operating system dependent, so even if you installed in step 2 with Unix-like command environment on a Windows machine (e.g., using [Git Bash](https://gitforwindows.org/), [Cygwin](https://www.cygwin.com/), or a VM with [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/)), you will still need to choose the proper file separator for Windows, i.e., ```\\```). See example env.json files for both MacOS and Windows ([S8 Text](S8-JSON-file-parameter-guide)).
    * Automatic setup: Upon the initiation of your first run, you will be prompted to enter the above four paths if you did not choose to complete the manual setup. Enter them as prompted, following the guidelines detailed above and exemplified in [S7](S7-JSON-configuration-files). Note that you may at any time update paths with ```python run env_setup``` to rewrite this file if the information should change.
