# How to use ASCENT
## Running the ASCENT Pipeline
See [Running the Pipeline](../Getting_Started.md#setting-up-a-run-of-ascent).

## Submitting NEURON jobs
We provide scripts for the user to submit NEURON jobs in `src/neuron/`.
The `submit.py` script takes the input of the ***Run***
configuration and submits a NEURON call for each independent fiber
within an `n_sim/`. These scripts are called using similar syntax as
`pipeline.py`: `"./submit.<ext> <run indices>,"` where `<run
indices>` is a space-separated list of integers. Note that these
submission scripts expect to be called from a directory with the
structure generated by `Simulation.export_nsims()` at the location
defined by `"ASCENT_NSIM_EXPORT_PATH"` in `env.json`.

### Cluster submissions
When using a high-performance computing cluster running SLURM:
1. Set your default parameters, particularly your partition (can be found in
`"config/system/slurm_params.json"`). The partition you set here (default is "common"
) will apply to all `submit.py` runs.
2. Optionally, set your `"submission_context"` to `"auto"`, and configure your `run.json` with the
appropriate hostname prefix. (Only necessary if you plan to submit runs both locally and
on a cluster, see [Run Parameters](../JSON/JSON_parameters/run).)
3. Many parameters which `submit.py` sources from JSON configuration files can be overridden with command line arguments. For more information, see [Command-Line Arguments](command_line_args).
4.
## Other Scripts
We provide scripts to help users efficiently manage data created by ASCENT. Run all of these scripts from the directory
to which you installed ASCENT (i.e., `"ASCENT_PROJECT_PATH"` as defined in `config/system/env.json`). For specific controls associated with each script, see [Command Line Arguments](command_line_args).

### `scripts/import_n_sims.py`
To import NEURON simulation outputs (e.g., thresholds, recordings of V<sub>m</sub>) from your `ASCENT_NSIM_EXPORT_PATH`
(i.e., `<"ASCENT_NSIM_EXPORT_PATH" as defined in env.json>/n_sims/<concatenated indices as
sample_model_sim_nsim>/data/outputs/`) into the native file structure
(see [ASCENT Data Hierarchy](../Data_Hierarchy), `samples/<sample_index>/models/<model_index>/sims/<sim_index>/n_sims/<n_sim_index>/data/outputs/`)
run this script from your `"ASCENT_PROJECT_PATH"`.

`python run import_n_sims <list of run indices>`

The script will load each listed Run configuration file from `config/user/runs/<run_index>.json` to determine for which
Sample, Model(s), and Sim(s) to import the NEURON simulation data. This script will check for any missing thresholds and skip that import if any are found. Override this by passing the flag `--force`. To delete n_sim folders from your output directory after importing, pass the flag `--delete-nsims`. For more information, see [Command-Line Arguments](command_line_args).

### `scripts/clean_samples.py`
If you would like to remove all contents for a single sample (i.e., `samples/<sample_index>/`) EXCEPT a list of files
(e.g., `sample.json`, `model.json`) or EXCEPT a certain file format (e.g., all files ending `.mph`), use this script.
Run this script from your `"ASCENT_PROJECT_PATH"`. Files to keep are specified within the python script.

`python run clean_samples <list of sample indices>`

### `scripts/tidy_samples.py`
If you would like to remove ONLY CERTAIN FILES for a single sample (i.e., `samples/<sample_index>/`), use this script.
 This script is useful for removing logs, runtimes, special,
 and *.bat or *.sh scripts. Run this script from your `"ASCENT_PROJECT_PATH"`. Files to remove are specified within the python script.

`python run tidy_samples <list of sample indices>`

## Data analysis tools

### Python Query class

The general usage of Query is as follows:

1.  In the context of a Python script, the user specifies the search
    criteria (think of these as "keywords" that filter your data) in the
    form of a JSON configuration file (see `query_criteria.json` in [Query Parameters](../JSON/JSON_parameters/query_criteria)).

2.  These search criteria are used to construct a Query object, and the
    search for matching ***Sample***, ***Model***, and ***Sim***
    configurations is performed using the method `run()`.

3.  The search results are in the form of a hierarchy of ***Sample***,
    ***Model***, and ***Sim*** indices, which can be accessed using the
    `summary()` method.

Using this "summary" of results, the user is then able to use various
convenience methods provided by the Query class to build paths to
arbitrary points in the data file structure as well as load saved Python
objects (e.g., Sample and Simulation class instances).

The Query class’s initializer takes one argument: a dictionary in the
appropriate structure for query criteria ([Query Parameters](../JSON/JSON_parameters/query_criteria)) *or* a string value containing
the path (relative to the pipeline repository root) to the desired JSON
configuration with the criteria. Put concisely, a user may filter
results either manually by using known indices or automatically by using
parameters as they would be found in the main configuration files. It is
***extremely important*** to note that the Query class must be
initialized with the working directory set to the root of the pipeline
repository (i.e., `sys.path.append(ASCENT_PROJECT_PATH)` in your
script). Failure to set the working directory correctly will break the
initialization step of the Query class.

After initialization, the search can be performed by calling Query’s
`run()` method. This method recursively dives into the data file structure
of the pipeline searching for configurations (i.e., ***Sample***,
***Model***, and/or ***Sim***) that satisfy `query_criteria.json`. Once
`run()` has been called, the results can be fetched using the `summary()`
accessor method. In addition, the user may pass in a file path to
`excel_output()` to generate an Excel sheet summarizing the Query
results.

Query also has methods for accessing configurations and Python objects
within the `samples/` directory based on a list of ***Sample***,
***Model***, or ***Sim*** indices. The `build_path()` method returns the
path of the configuration or object for the provided indices. Similarly,
the `get_config()` and `get_object()` methods return the configuration
dictionary or saved Python object (using the Pickle package),
respectively, for a list of configuration indices. These tools allow for
convenient looping through the data associated with search criteria.

In addition, we have included a few data analysis methods in the Query
class: `heatmaps()`, `barcharts_compare_models()`, and
`barcharts_compare_samples()`. Since individual use cases for data
analysis can differ greatly, these methods are not considered "core"
functionality and can instead be treated as examples for how one might
use the Query class. Example uses of these Query
convenience methods are included in `examples/analysis/`.

  - `plot_fiberset.py`

### Video generation for NEURON state variables

In `examples/analysis/` we provide a script, `plot_video.py`, that creates
an animation of saved state variables as a function of space and time
(e.g., transmembrane potentials, MRG gating parameters). The user can
plot `n_sim` data saved in a `data/output/` folder by referencing indices
for ***Sample***, ***Model***, ***Sim***, inner, fiber, and `n\_sim`. The
user may save the animation as either a `*.mp4` or `*.gif` file to the
`data/output/` folder.

The `plot_video.py` script is useful for determining necessary simulation
durations (e.g., the time required for an action potential to propagate
the length of the fiber) to avoid running unnecessarily long
simulations. Furthermore, the script is useful for observing onset
response to kilohertz frequency block, which is important for
determining the appropriate duration of time to allow for the fiber
onset response to complete.

Users need to determine an appropriate number of points along the fiber
to record state variables. Users have the option to either record state
variables at all Nodes of Ranvier (myelinated fibers) or sections
(unmyelinated fibers), or at discrete locations along the length of the
fiber ([Sim Parameters](../JSON/JSON_parameters/sim)).
